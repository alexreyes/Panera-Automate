# Legality of this Project: 
I'm not really sure how legal all of this is and I advise you use this app with caution. Any problems you face due to the abuse of getting free food is not my fault. So don't use it too frequently or make what you're doing to obvious. Like the fight club, the first rule of Panera Automate is to not talk about Panera Automate.
